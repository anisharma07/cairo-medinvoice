# Medinvoice on Starknet

**Medinvoice** is a decentralized healthcare invoice management system built on Starknet, leveraging the power of Cairo smart contracts. This project combines ERC-20 token functionality with invoice management capabilities, enabling secure, transparent, and efficient healthcare payment processing on the blockchain.

Key benefits include immutable invoice records, automated payment processing, reduced intermediary costs, and enhanced transparency in healthcare billing. The project is fully compatible with Starknet's ecosystem and follows best practices for security and gas optimization.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- [Scarb](https://docs.swmansion.com/scarb/) (Starknet's package manager)
- [Starkli](https://book.starkli.rs) (CLI tool to deploy and interact with Starknet contracts)
- A Starknet wallet (e.g., [Braavos](https://braavos.app), [Argent X](https://www.argent.xyz/argent-x/))
- Starknet testnet ETH (e.g., from [Starknet faucet](https://faucet.starknet.io/))

---

## 📦 Build the Contract

Make sure you are in the project root directory, then run:

```bash
scarb build
```

This compiles your contract and outputs the Sierra and CASM artifacts into `./target/dev/`.

---

## 🚀 Deploy Using Starkli

rpc: https://starknet-sepolia.public.blastapi.io/rpc/v0_8

### Step 1: Declare the contract

```bash
starkli declare target/dev/sn_medi_invoice_MedInvoiceContract.contract_class.json #med invoice
```

Save the returned class hash.

### Step 2: Deploy the contract

```bash
starkli deploy <class_hash> <medi_token_address> <recipient_address> # med invoice
```

- `initial_tokens`: Number of tokens to mint (without decimals, the multiplier is automatically applied)
- `recipient_address`: Starknet address of the initial token holder
